
# 🤖 Robotic Hazard Waste Detection

An **intelligent autonomous system** that leverages **computer vision** and **deep learning** to identify and classify hazardous waste materials in **real-time**. This project is designed to enhance **safety protocols** and streamline **waste management** in hazardous environments.

The system is built using **SSD-MobileNetV2 architecture** for efficient object detection and can be integrated with **Raspberry Pi** and camera modules for practical deployment.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Detect hazardous waste automatically and in real-time
- Classify different types of hazardous materials
- Reduce human exposure to dangerous environments
- Provide a reliable and automated waste management solution

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dararith-ux/roboticfinalproject.git
cd roboticfinalproject
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Prepare Dataset** — Organize images and annotations in `datasetrecord/`.
2. **Train Model** — Use SSD-MobileNetV2 for object detection using the scripts in `training/`.
3. **Monitor Training** — Visualize metrics with TensorBoard.

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=training
```

4. **Export Model** — Save trained models to `exported_model/`.
5. **Optional Conversion** — Convert TensorFlow models to ONNX for other platforms.
6. **Inference** — Run object detection with scripts in `source/`.
